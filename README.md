## Project Title: Telegram bot with restaurant app
> The goal is to make ordering food from restaurant easier and more convenient. The bot works right inside the telegram ; this means that a user can order food and access restaurant services without any extra steps and apps.  This means that while the user is chatting on Telegram, he can also browse restaurant menus, orders meal, and even get updates â€“ all in the same app. So, whether it's a juicy burger or tasty pizza , the bot and web app combo makes getting the restaurant fix easy-peasy, all thanks to Telegram.
